    \section{INTRODUCTION}

    Bohr’s principle of complementarity is one of the most fundamental concepts distinguishing
    the microscopically quantum world from the macroscopically classical world. In fact,
    complementarity itself is a more general concept of the most familiar example of the wave-
    particle duality. In classical physics, physical phenomena are represented in either the particle
    model or the wave model. Physicists successfully gave the precise and elegant descriptions of
    those phenomena, such as the Newtonian mechanics and Maxwell’s wave theory to radiation.
    People consequently expected that all entities are either particles or waves. It was, however,
    the double-slit experiment of electrons that greatly perplexed humankind. In 1927 Niels Bohr
    summarized that the wave and particle models are complementary; if a measurement proves
    the wave character of an entity(matter or radiation) , then it is impossible to prove the particle
    character of it, and conversely. Furthermore, our understanding of the entity is incomplete
    when only considering one type of the measurement that reveals the particle(wave) aspects,
    unless we take into account the other.

    The ``Principle of Complementarity" is generalized into the following statement:
    \begin{quote}
      For each degree of freedom the dynamical variables are a pair 
      of complementarity observables.
    \end{quote}
    A less formal, but more acquainted saying of the above is:
    \begin{quote}
      No matter how the system is well-prepared, 
      there is always a measurement whose outcome is utterly unpredictable.
  \end{quote}
  The principle provides a comprehensive knowledge that a physical system that enforce
  complementarity varies from one experimental situation to another. The most prominent
  situation is the example of Heisenberg’s position-momentum uncertainty relation
  \begin{equation}
    \delta x\delta p_x\geq\frac{\hbar}{2}
  \end{equation}
  In the archetype case of the double-slit experiment, the relation above makes it impossible to
  determine welcher Weg(which path) the particle passes through without destroying its
  interference pattern. In our discussions, we consider another experimental situation that makes
  a `detour’ around the position-momentum uncertainty adversity. Specifically, we tend to obtain
  the which-path information of an atom without dramatically smearing out the interference
  pattern. This, however, does not violate the principle of complementarity, and the
  complementarity is still manifest though the position-momentum uncertainty turns out to cause
  no effect. At the end, we will be guided to the conclusion of the interaction between the
  measuring apparatus and the system being observed. For simplicity we will modify the original
  experimental setup to present a clear model.

  \section{THE MACH-ZEHNDER INTERFEROMETER}

    $M_A$ and $M_B$ the atom interferes with itself at 
    the beam splitter $BS_2$ before entering the detectors.}

  \end{figure}
    
  If we send many atoms toward the BS, and we detect both in the transmission (T) and the reflection (R) directions, we find that half of the atoms have been transmitted, half reflected. We write in terms of probabilities:
P(T)= P(R)=1/2.

  We consider the Mach–Zehnder interferometer shown in Figure~\ref{interferometer}. 
  It consists of a source S, which emits particles into the 
  interferometer along the x direction such that at any given 
  time, a maximum of a single particle is in the interferometer. 
  The particles first hit beam splitter $BS_1$ through which they 
  are transmitted to path A or deflected to path B. Two mirrors $M_A$ 
  and $M_B$ let these paths cross again at a second beam splitter $BS_2$ . 
  At the exit of $BS_2$ are two detectors, $D_X$ along the X 
  direction and DY along the Y direction, as indicated in Figure ~\ref{interferometer}.

  \subsection{EXPLANATION OF PARTICLE}
  Classically, we can expect two results:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item With using the “polarizing beam splitters”, 
    the transmission or reflection is determined by the state of 
    polarization of the atom, which is said that an atom which 
    has been transmitted (reflected) will always be transmitted (reflected). 
    In this case, it is easy to find that: Prob{$D_X$}=0, and Prob{$D_Y$}=1. 
    \item If we assume that the transmission and reflection are 
    determined by parameters we cannot control, then the transmission and 
    reflection are random when an atom arrives at the beam splitter. In 
    this case, of course, Prob{$D_X$}=Prob{$D_Y$}=$\frac{1}{2}$. 
    From mathematical point of view , this result is 
    obtained by multiplying probabilities, which means 
    precisely that the ``choice” at $BS_2$ is independent of that at $BS_1$.
    \footnote{V. Scarani, A. Suarez, “Introducing quantum 
    mechanics:One-particle interferences”, Am. J. Phy. 66, 718-721(1998).}
  \end{enumerate}

  If we set L=0, we can get~(\ref{eq:3}) again obviously.


  \subsection{EXPLANATION OF WAVE}
  On the other hand, we can obtain the same result from 
  the point of view of wave. When the atom pass through the 
  beam splitters, the amplitudes of plane waves(wave functions for atoms) 
  will be modified by reflection and transmission. At the first 
  beam splitter an atom has two possible outcomes: 
  either transmission with an amplitude t into path A or reflection 
  with amplitude r into path B. Besides, the two plane waves will 
  also both acquire a phase $\delta=kl$, where $l$ is the length for path A 
  or path B, and k stands for the wave number for the atom.

  Therefore, the probability amplitude for the detector $D_X$ 
  is the sum of the probability amplitude from path A, which is 
  $tre^{i\delta A}$, and that from path B, which is $tre^{i\delta B}$. 
  Then the probability that an atom can be detected at the detector $D_X$ is 
  the square of the modulus of the sum of these two amplitudes:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:4}
    \begin{align}
      Prob\{D_X\}&=|tre^{i\delta A}+tre^{i\delta B}|^2\\
      &=rr^*tt^*[2+e^{i(\delta A-\delta B)}+e^{-i(\delta A-\delta B)}]\\
      &=2RT(1+cos\delta)
    \end{align}
  \end{equation}
  
  Where $R=rr^*$ and $T=tt^*$ stand for the reflection 
  and transmission probabilities, respectively, 
  and $\delta=\delta A-\delta B$ is the phase difference arising 
  from the difference between lengths of the path A and path B and the wave loss. 
  The atoms detected by Dx all experience once mirror reflection and once 
  beam-splitter reflection regardless of path A or path B, consequently, 
  the phase difference due to wave loss eliminate. Thus:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:5}
    \delta=k(l_A-l_B)=kl=L
  \end{equation}

  Substituting~(\ref{eq:5}) into~(\ref{eq:4}) we can obtain:
  \begin{equation}
    Prob\{D_X\}=4RTcos^2\frac{L}{2}
  \end{equation}
  
  If we assume the beam splitters are identical and symmetric, 
  and set R=T=1/2(50-50 beam splitter), we can obtain again:
  \begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}  
      Prob\{D_X\}&=cos^2\frac{L}{2}\\
      Prob\{D_Y\}&=1-Prob\{D_X\}=sin^2\frac{L}{2}
    \end{align}  
  \end{subequations
  
  But, of course, this model cannot explain why no half-atom can be observed: as usual, we find that neither of the two classical models of physical phenomena ~particles and waves! alone can describe quantum interferences.
  
  
  \subsection{EXPERIMENT FACT}
  In the real experiment the observed probabilities are P(D1)=0, P(D2)=1 i.e., all atoms end in D2! 
  Recall that each atom is alone while traveling through the interferometer, and that no ‘‘halfatom’’ can be observed. Moreover, each atom undergoes two impacts at two different BSs, exactly as in the setup described in Fig. 2. But in Fig. 3, two paths lead to the same detector: that is, experiment shows that the existence of many possible paths leading to detection has an influence on the experimental outcomes. Since each individual atom behaves as if it had ‘‘explored’’ all the possible paths, people speak of an atom ‘‘interfering with itself.’’

  \subsection{ONE-PARTICLE QUANTUM INTEREFENCE}
  Inside the interferometer, we associate the state 
  $|x\rangle$ and $|y\rangle$ with the particle at any time 
  corresponding to its direction of propagation. For simplicity, we 
  firstly assume that both the path A and path B have the same 
  length, under such conditions, we can neglect the phase 
  of the particle on the trajectories between the beam splitter and mirrors. 

  Two derivations that the phase shift between the transmitted 
  and the reflected wave fields of a semireflecting lossless mirror 
  is $\frac{\pi}{2}$ have been given by Degiorgio 
  \footnote{Vittorio Degiorgio, ``Phase shift between the 
  transmitted an the reflected optical fields of a semireflecting 
  lossess mirror is $\frac{\pi}{2}$”.}
  and proved by using well-known properties of unitary 
  operators in quantum mechanics by Zeilinger. 
  \footnote{A, Zeilinger, ``General properties of 
  lossless beam splitters in interferometry”.}
  (See ~\ref{appendix:reflection})

  Therefore, the role of the beam splitter 
  for the atom states in this experiment can be expressed as:
  \begin{subequations}
    \label{eq:whole}
    \begin{align}
      |x\rangle \rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt2}(|x\rangle+i|y\rangle)\\
      |y\rangle \rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt2}(|y\rangle+i|x\rangle)
    \end{align}
  \end{subequations}

  The combination of the mirrors MA and MB acts as:
  \begin{subequations}
    \label{eq:whole}
    \begin{align}
      |x\rangle \rightarrow i|y\rangle\\
      |y\rangle \rightarrow i|x\rangle
    \end{align}
  \end{subequations}

  If we combine these transformations ,we can see that the interferometer acts as :
  \begin{subequations}
    \label{eq:whole}
    \begin{align}
      |x\rangle \rightarrow e^{i\pi}|x\rangle\\
      |y\rangle \rightarrow e^{i\pi}|y\rangle
    \end{align}
  \end{subequations}

  Because the atoms are injected from the source along the x direction, 
  which is said that it is at the state $|x\rangle$, 
  after passing through the interferometer, 
  the state will transform to $e^{i\pi}|x\rangle$ 
  at the exit of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. 
  The detector $D_X$ measures the component $|x\rangle$ of 
  the outgoing state $|\Psi_{out}|$, and $D_Y$ measures the 
  component $|y\rangle$ of the outgoing state $|\Psi_{out}|$ with the probabilities:
  \begin{subequations}
    \label{eq:whole}
    \begin{align}
      Prob\{D_X\}=\|P_{|x\rangle}|\Psi_{out}\rangle\|^2=|\langle x|\Psi_{out}\rangle|^2\\
      Prob\{D_Y\}=\|P_{|y\rangle}|\Psi_{out}\rangle\|^2=|\langle y|\Psi_{out}\rangle|^2
    \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
  Where $P_{|x\rangle}$ and $P_{|y\rangle}$ are the projectors onto 
  $|x\rangle$ and $|y\rangle$, respectively. And $\Psi_{out}=e^{i\pi}|x\rangle$.
  Obviously: 
  \begin{subequations}
    \label{eq:3}
    \begin{align}
      Prob\{D_X\}=1\\
      Prob\{D_Y\}=0
    \end{align}
  \end{subequations}

  which means that only the detector Dx can detect the atoms, 
  and there are no atoms can be find in detector $D_Y$. Comparing with 
  the classical case, this makes a big difference. 
  This effect is known as ``one-particle quantum interference” and 
  is one of the typical nonclassical and counterintuitive 
  effects of the quantum physics.
  \footnote{V. Scarani, Quantum Physics: A First Encounter (Oxford U. P., Oxford, 2006).}
  
  If we change the length of the two paths, for example, 
  increasing the length of one of the paths A or B leads to 
  an additional phase difference of the states before $BS_2$ and 
  can be used to control of the interference. 
  Now we add a delay line (which can be an optical fiber), 
  see Figure~\ref{delay}, and we can consider the following two cases:

  \subsubsection{}
  If the delay line l is short compared to the coherence 
  length (See Appendix B) of the laser, then the line length l 
  is corresponding to the optical length $L=\omega l/c$, where the 
  $\omega$ is the frequency of the atom and the l 
  is the length of the fiber.

  The state in the basis of the eigenstates of a beam splitter is 
  $|\psi\rangle = (|T\rangle + i|R\rangle)$, thus after the atom 
  passed through $BS_1$, $|T\rangle$ stands for the atom 
  already selected the path A, and versa vice, 
  $|R\rangle$ stands for the atom already chose the path B. 
  When the atom just passes through the $BS_2$, the atom has 
  two states: $|x\rangle$ or $|y\rangle$. Then we express 
  the state $(|T\rangle and |R\rangle)$ before $BS_2$ by the after 
  state($|x\rangle$ and $|y\rangle$):
  \begin{subequations}
    \label{eq:1}
    \begin{align}
      |T\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt2}(|y\rangle+i|x\rangle)\\
      |R\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt2}(|x\rangle+i|y\rangle)
    \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
    
  Consider that the delay line L will add an extra phase 
  factor $e^{iL}$ for path A, then the state vector arriving at $BS_2$ is: 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:2}
    |\psi'\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt2}(e^{iL}|T\rangle+i|R\rangle)
  \end{equation}

  Combine~(\ref{eq:1}) and~(\ref{eq:2}), we can get:
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{align}
      |\psi'\rangle&=\frac{1}{\sqrt2}
      [e^{iL}\frac{1}{\sqrt2}(|y\rangle+i|x\rangle)
      +i\frac{1}{\sqrt2}(|x\rangle+i|y\rangle)]\\
      &=\frac{1}{2}[(cosL+isinL-1)|y\rangle+i(cosL+isinL+1)|x\rangle]\\
      &= isin\frac{L}{2}(cos\frac{L}{2}+isin\frac{L}{2})|y\rangle
      +icos\frac{L}{2}(cos\frac{L}{2}+isin\frac{L}{2})|x\rangle\\
      &=ie^{iL}(sin\frac{L}{2}|y\rangle+cos\frac{L}{2}|x\rangle)   
    \end{align}
  \end{equation}

  By squaring the moduli of the probability amplitudes we can find that: 
  \begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
      Prob\{D_X\}=cos^2\frac{L}{2}\\
      Prob\{D_Y\}=sin^2\frac{L}{2}
    \end{align}
  \end{subequations}

  \subsubsection{}
  If the delay line L is much longer than the coherence 
  length, then the time at which an atom taking the longer 
  path is detected will be distinguishably longer than that 
  of an atom taking the shorter path. In principle, one can be 
  able to distinguish which path an atom takes, and there 
  should be no interference.
  \footnote{J. Galvez, C. H. Holbrow, M. J. Pysher, 
  J. W. Martin, N. Courtemanche, L. Heilig, and J. Spencer, 
  “Interference with correlated atoms: 
  Five quantum mechanics experiments for undergraduates”, 
  Am. J. Phy. [DOI: 10.1119/1.1796811]} 
  Therefore, we can finds the classical probabilites: 
  \begin{equation}
    Prob\{D_X\}=Prob\{D_Y\}=\frac{1}{2}
  \end{equation}

  The heart of quantum interference: 
  indistinguishability. It is only possible to observe either 
  the path or the interference of the atom but never both simultaneously.
  \footnote{T. Hellmuth, H Walther, A. Zajonc, 
  and W. Schleich, ``Delayed-choice experiments in quantum interference”}
  If one can (even in priciple) distinguish the path each atom has taken, 
  then one obtains the classical probabilities. 
  In other terms, interference takes place only 
  when the atom could have taken more than 
  one path to give the same final result.


  \section{\label{sec:level1}WHICH-WAY DETECTOR}

  In this section,  we put two nondestructive detectors $\tilde{D}_A$ 
  on path A and $\tilde{D}_B$ on path B to detect which path was chosen. 
  (see Figure~\ref{detector}) 
  After we add these two detectors, the probabilities 
  $Prob\{X\}=Prob\{Y\}=\frac{1}{2}$, equivalent to the 
  classical result and independent of the result detected by $\tilde{D}_A$ 
  or $\tilde{D}_B$.
  However, we cannot observe the interefence anymore. No matter how long the 
  path is, the interefence would disappear immediately after we put the detectors.
  It shows that the concept of the path is not totally correct in quantum physics.

  \begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=3in]{Detector.eps}
    \caption{Which-way detection in the Mach–Zehnder interferometer. Additional 
    (nondestructive) detectors $\tilde{D}_A$ and $\tilde{D}_B$ 
    are placed on the paths A and B.
    The entanglement of the particle with $\tilde{D}_A$ and $\tilde{D}_B$ 
    provides information on
    which path was taken by it. This information destroys the quantum 
    interference and results in detection probabilities equal 
    to 1/2 in $D_X$ and $D_Y$ corresponding to the classical result.}
    \label{detector}
  \end{figure}

  \section{\label{sec:level1}WHICH-WAY ENTANGLER}

  An important property of quantum physics is that the interefence would 
  disappear after we put the dectors $\tilde{D}_A$ and $\tilde{D}_B$. 
  We can use a simple extension of the Mach–Zehnder 
  interferometer to illustrate the property. We called this model a 
  which-way entangler. In addition, we assume that the particle is 
  emitted into the interferometer in an excited state $|e\rangle$, and 
  relaxed into the ground state $|g\rangle$ by emission of an atom by the 
  detector $\tilde{D}_A$ or $\tilde{D}_B$. We denote the atom state by 
  $|A\rangle$ or $|B\rangle$ determined by which detector received the 
  atom, and use the notation $|0\rangle$ for otherwise. 

  The state at the entrance of the interferometer is 
  \begin{eqnarray}
    |\Psi_{in}\rangle=|x\rangle\otimes|0\rangle\otimes|e\rangle.
    \label{eq:one}
  \end{eqnarray}
  After the first beam splitter, the state is
  \begin{eqnarray}
    |\Psi_1\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt2}[|x\rangle+i|y\rangle]\otimes|0\rangle
    \otimes|e\rangle.
  \end{eqnarray}
  The action of the detectors $\tilde{D}_A$ or $\tilde{D}_B$ leads to 
  the entangled state
  \begin{eqnarray}
    |\Psi_2\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt2}[|x\rangle\otimes|A\rangle
    +i|y\rangle\otimes|B\rangle]\otimes|g\rangle.
  \end{eqnarray}
  After the mirrors, the state is
  \begin{eqnarray}
    |\Psi_3\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt2}[i|y\rangle\otimes|A\rangle-|x\rangle
    \otimes|B\rangle]\otimes|g\rangle.
  \end{eqnarray}
  Finally, after the second beam splitter, the state is
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:6}
    \begin{align}
      |\Psi_{out}\rangle&=\frac{1}{2}[(i|y\rangle-|x\rangle)\otimes|A\rangle-
      (|x\rangle+i|y\rangle)\otimes|B\rangle]\otimes|g\rangle\\
      &=
      \frac{1}{2}[i|y\rangle\otimes(|A\rangle-|B\rangle)-|x\rangle\otimes
      (|A\rangle+|B\rangle)]\otimes|g\rangle.
    \end{align}
  \end{equation}
  Hence, the probabilities are
  \begin{subequations}
    \label{eq:whole}
    \begin{align}
      Prob\{X\}=\|P_{|x\rangle}\otimes I\otimes I|\Psi_{out}\rangle\|^2=
      \frac{1}{4}\||A\rangle+|B\rangle\|^2=\frac{1}{2},\\
      Prob\{Y\}=\|P_{|y\rangle}\otimes I\otimes I|\Psi_{out}\rangle\|^2=
      \frac{1}{4}\||A\rangle-|B\rangle\|^2=\frac{1}{2}.
    \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
  We can see that the interefence effect vanishes. Both of the probabilities are 
  $\frac{1}{2}$ as the probabilities in classical again. Obviously, 
  we can observe that if we only 
  put one detector on only one path, the result would become the same as we just 
  dicuss. 
  
  \section{QUANTUM ERASER}
  In the preceding section we have seen that it is the system-detector correlations which account for the dramatic effects of the measuring apparatus on the system of interest. It is no surprise that coherence is destroyed as soon as one has which-way information, but here no uncontrollable scattering events were involved in destroying the interference (wave-like) behavior. One then wonders whether it might not be possible to retrieve the coherent interference cross-terms by removing (‘erasing’) the which-way information contained in the detectors. In this sense, If we erase the which-way information in the microwave cavities, will spin coherence be restored? Notice that if we considered the coherence to be lost because of a random scattering or other stochastic perturbations, this question would never come up. In fact, we shall see that interference effects can be restored by manipulating the which-way detectors long after the atoms have passed. Some memorable remarks on this problem would read:

  By applying or not applying the eraser mechanism before measuring the state of the microwave cavities we can, at will, force the atomic beam into either: (1) a state with a known path, and no possibility of interference effects in any subsequent measurement; (2) a state with both A path and B path present with a known relative phase. Interference effects are then not only observable, but predictable. And we can decide which to do after the interaction is over and the atom is far from the cavities, so there can be no thought of any physical influence on the atom’s centre-of-mass wavefunction! From this, it is pretty clear that present quantum theory not only does not use—it does not even dare to mention—the notion of a ‘real physical situation’. Defenders of the theory say that this notion is philosophically naive, a throwback to outmoded ways of thinking, and that recognition of this constitutes deep new wisdom about the nature of human knowledge. We say that it constitutes a violent irrationality, that somewhere in this theory the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality has become lost, and the result has more the character of medieval necromancy than of science. It has been show that quantum optics, with its vast new technological capability, might be able to provide the experimental clue that will show us to resolve these contradictions.

  In the following we try to show how to resolve these contradictions and suggest further tests of complementarity in quantum mechanics within the framework of modern quantum optics. 

  Consider the Mach–Zehnder interferometer, 
  modified in the following way. We assume that the atom after 
  emission in one of the two D detectors travels to an auxiliary atom E, 
  the quantum eraser, where it can be absorbed see Figure~\ref{eraser} 
  To activate the quantum eraser, the observer has to open a 
  channel c connecting detectors $D_A$ and $D_B$ to atom E. This opening 
  can be done at any time after the emission of the atoms even 
  when the quantum particle has left the Mach–Zehnder interferometer. 
  Let $|\gamma\rangle$ be the initial 
  ground state of the quantum eraser $\epsilon$ and let 
  $|\epsilon\rangle$ be its excited state. We consider the evolution of the system 
  ``atom+atom+quantum eraser.” If the channel c is closed, then the 
  state just before the final detection is identical to~(\ref{eq:6}) 
  with the additional state $|\gamma\rangle$ of $\epsilon$.

  \begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=3in]{Eraser.eps}
    \caption{Which-way detection in the Mach–Zehnder interferometer. Additional 
    (nondestructive) detectors $\tilde{D}_A$ and $\tilde{D}_B$ are 
    placed on the paths A and B.
    The entanglement of the particle with $\tilde{D}_A$ and $\tilde{D}_B$ 
    provides information on
    which path was taken by it. This information destroys the quantum interference 
    and results in detection probabilities equal to $1/2$ in $D_X$ and $D_Y$ 
    corresponding to the classical result.}
    \label{eraser}
  \end{figure}

  In contrast, if channel c is open, the atom travels from the detectors 
  $D_A$ and $D_B$ to the eraser $\epsilon$ where with some 
  probability it can be absorbed by exciting the quantum eraser. 
  Therefore the quantum erasure occurs only for some 
  outcomes of the interference experiments.

  Do we now (after erasure) regain interference fringes? The answer is yes, but how can that be? The atoms are now far removed from the micromaser cavities and so “there can be no thought of any physical influence on the atom’s centre-of-mass wave function”. The answer to this question is given mathematically as follows.

  For those cases where the atom is absorbed by ε, the system state is projected onto
  \begin{equation}
    |\Phi\rangle=-|x\rangle\otimes|0\rangle\otimes|g\rangle\otimes|\epsilon\rangle
  \end{equation}

  the probabilities Prob\{X\} and Prob\{Y\} are now replaced by the 
  conditional probabilities $P\{X|abs\}$ and $P\{Y|abs\}$,

  \begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
      P\{X|abs\}=(-\langle x|x\rangle\langle0|0\rangle\langle g|g\rangle\langle\epsilon
      |\epsilon\rangle)^2=1\\
      P\{Y|abs\}=(-\langle y|x\rangle\langle0|0\rangle\langle g|g\rangle\langle\epsilon
      |\epsilon\rangle)^2=1
    \end{align}
  \end{subequations}

  We see that the erasure of the which-path information by the absorption of the atom by the quantum eraser completely restores the original quantum interference.

  Here is the physical interpretation of this calculation. 
  After an atom has run the gauntlet from the oven to the screen, 
  passing through deterctors and leaving its tell-tale 
  atom, we record an event somewhere on the final detector $D_X$ or $D_Y$. 
  Then we return to the eraser atom, open the channel and allow the absorption 
  of the tell-tale atom. When we observe absorption of the 
  atom in the eraser we know that erasure has been completed. 
  In this event the atom is counted as a ‘yes’-atom.

  Then we wait for another atom to pass through the system from oven to screen. Again we record an event on the screen and then turn to the eraser. This time suppose that, upon opening the shutter, we observe no absorption of the atom in the quantum eraser detector. This will be the case half of the time, as explained above. Now we count the atom as a ‘no’-atom.

  We repeat the above sequence many times. Eventually, the ’yes’-atoms will build up the detection of $D_Y$ and the ‘no’-atoms produce only the detection of $D_X$.

    \section{General Properties of Lossless Beam Splitters In Interferometry}
    
    Here is the derivation of the general relations 
    between the reflection and transmission state 
    vectors of a lossless beam splitter. For simplicity, 
    we discuss the  reflection and transmission amplitudes 
    that represent the state vectors in the Hilbert space. The 
    concept of a general lossless beam splitter is to consider two 
    incoming and two outgoing waves and with reflection amplitudes 
    $r_{RR}$ and $r_{LL}$ and transmission amplitudes $t_{LR}$ and 
    $t_{RL}$ connecting the outgoing amplitudes to the incoming 
    amplitudes(Fig. 1). We denote $u_{iL}$ and $u_{iR}$ the 
    incoming amplitudes from the left side and the right side 
    respectively; $u_{oL}$ and $u_{oR}$ the outgoing amplitudes 
    on the left side and the right side respectively. 
    The relation between the outgoing and the incoming amplitudes is given by

    \begin{eqnarray}
      u_{oL}=r_{LL}u_{iL}+t_{LR}u_{iR}\\
      u_{oR}=t_{RL}u_{iL}+r_{RR}u_{iR}
    \end{eqnarray}
    We may write that into the matrix notation,
    \begin{eqnarray}
      u_{oL}=r_{LL}u_{iL}+t_{LR}u_{iR}\\
      u_{oR}=t_{RL}u_{iL}+r_{RR}u_{iR}
    \end{eqnarray}
